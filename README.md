RedditBot
=========

A simple Reddit bot in Python.

A software bot is a program that can interact with websites autonomously. They can be as simple or as complex as you want them to be.

The bot runs in the background and monitors a website. When it sees a change (like a post on Reddit), it can reply to it, upvote, or do any other task it was programmed to.

 This bot has been modified to stalk a user and post a custom comment in every post they make. 
 Just modify the first three variables in https://github.com/SikZone/RedditBot/blob/master/Part2/reply_post.py
